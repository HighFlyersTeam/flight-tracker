Flight Tracker is the best way for you to visualize flights. It was created by Ivan Ho, Alexander Houck, Anthony Johnson, Charlie Liu, Benjamin Rome, and Charles Tian as part of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Software Design and Documentation course. Their goal is to create a basic and intuitive interface to visualize publicly available flight information.

## Background
Flight planning is a difficult problem to solve for any shipping or passenger airline. It requires a lot of planning and reacting to opposing companies’ flight plans. Flight Tracker hopes to alleviate some of the pressure of this process by allowing users to filter flights by date, airline, time of day, and more, visualizing all flights that follow the user’s entered filters on a map. 

## Use Cases
Flight Tracker's interface allows the user to set various different filters to help them visualize and plan flights. Some of these filters include, but are not limited to, a starting and ending time, day of week, specific airlines, cargo and/or passenger airlines, starting destination, and ending destination.
