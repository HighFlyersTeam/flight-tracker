# Flight Tracker

Flight Tracker is the best way for you to visualize flights. It was created by Ivan Ho, Alexander Houck, Anthony Johnson, Charlie Liu, Benjamin Rome, and Charles Tian as part of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Software Design and Documentation course. Their goal is to create a basic and intuitive interface to visualize publicly available flight information.
